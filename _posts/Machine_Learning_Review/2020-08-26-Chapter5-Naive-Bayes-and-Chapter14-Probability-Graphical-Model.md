### Naive Bayes

##### Basic Ideas
**Supervised Learning**  
Problem Setting:  
*   Set of possible instances: $X$
*   Unknown target function (concept): $f: X\rightarrow Y$
*   Set of hypotheses (hypothesis class): $H = \{h\lvert h:X\rightarrow Y\}$

Given:  
*   Training set of instances of unknown target function $f$, $(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)})$, $(x^{(2)}, y^{(2)})$, ... , $(x^{(m)}, y^{(m)})$.

Output:  
*   Hypothesis $h\in H$ that best approximates target function.

**Discriminative Approaches**
*   Hypothesis $h \in H$ directly predicts the label $y$ given the features $x$  
    $$
    y = h(x) \,\,\,or\,\,\,p(y\lvert x)=h(x)
    $$
*   Define a loss function $L(h)$ and find hypothesis with minimum loss.
    *   Probabilistic model is a special case, like finding MLE or MAP.
*   Example: Linear regression  
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    &h_{\theta}(x) = \langle x,\theta\rangle \\
    &L(h_{\theta} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

**Generative Approaches**  
*   Hypothesis $h\in H$ specifies a generative probabilistic story for how the full data (x,y) was created
    $$
    h(x,y)=p(x,y)
    $$
* Pick a hypothesis by **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** or **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)**.  
* Example: Roll a weighted die  
    * Weights for each side($\theta$) define how the data are generated.  
    * Use MLE on the training data to learn $\theta$  
    
##### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)

**MLE vs. MAP**
Suppose we have data $D = \{x^{(i)} \}^N_{i=1}$,  

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\theta^{MLE} = \arg\max_\theta \prod_{i=1}^Np(x^{(i)}\lvert \theta) \\
&\theta^{MAP} = \arg\max_\theta \prod_{i=1}^Np(x^{(i)}\lvert \theta)p(\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

To be noticed, the $p(\theta)$ in MAP is the prior distribution.  

**Example: MLE of Exponential Distribution**  

*   First write the log-likelihood of the sample, that is
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{l}(\lambda) &= \sum_{i=1}^N\log f(x^{(i)})\\
    &= N\log(\lambda) - \lambda \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
*   Compute first derivative, set to zero, solve for $\lambda$.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial\mathcal{l}(\lambda)}{\partial\lambda} &= \frac{N}{\lambda} - \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)} = 0 \\
    &\Rightarrow \lambda^{MLE} = \frac{N}{\sum^N_{i=1}x^{i}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

##### Naive Bayes
**Generic Naive Bayes Model**  
*   Support: Depends on the choice of **event model**, $P(X_k\lvert Y)$.  
*   Model: Product of **prior** and the event model.  
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    P(X,Y) &= P(Y)P(X\lvert Y) \\
    &= P(Y)\prod_{k=1}^KP(x_k\lvert Y)
    \end{aligned}
    $$
*   Training: Find the **class-conditional** MLE parameters  
    *   For $P(Y)$, we find the MLE using all the data. For each $P(x_k\lvert Y)$ we condition on the data with the corresponding.  
*   Classification: Find the class that maximizes the posterior  
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \hat{y} &= \arg\max_y p(y\lvert X)) \,\,\,(Posterior)\\
    &= \arg\max_y\frac{p(X\lvert y)p(y)}{p(x)} \,\,\,(P(x) \,\,\,is\, fixed)\\
    &= \arg\max_y p(X\lvert y)p(y)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### Bayesian Network

##### Bayesian Networks
**Overview**  
*   A **Bayesian Network (BN)** consists of a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** and a set of conditional probability distributions.  
*   In a DAG  
    *   Each node denotes a random variable.  
    *   Each edge from $X$ to $Y$ represents that $X$ directly influences $Y$.  
    *   Formally: each variable X is independent of its non-descendants given its parents.  
*   Each node $X$ has a conditional probability distribution (CPD) representing $P(X\lvert Parents(X))$.  
*   BN provides a compact representation of a joint probability distribution, using chain rule.  
    $$
    P(X_1, \cdots X_n) = P(X_1)\prod_{i=2}^n P(X_i\lvert Parents(X_i))
    $$

**Advantages**  
*   Captures independence and conditional independence where they exist.  
*   Encodes the relevant portion of the full joint among variables where dependencies exist.  
*   Uses a graphical representation which lends insight into the complexity of inference.  

**The inference task in Bayesian networks**  
**Given**: values for some variables in the network (evidence), and a set of query variables  
**Do**: Compute the posterior distribution over the query variables.  

*   Variables that are neither evidence variables nor query variables are hidden variables.  
*   The BN representation is flexible enough that any set can be the evidence variables and any set can be the query variables.  
*   Inference by enumeration is an exact method (i.e. it computes the exact answer to a given query).   
*   It requires summing over a joint distribution whose size is exponential in the number of variables.   
*   In many cases we can do exact inference efficiently in large networks  
    *   key insight: save computation by pushing sums inward.  
*   In general, the Bayes net inference problem is NP-hard.   
*   There are also methods for approximate inference - these fer an answer which is "close".  
*   In general, the approximate inference problem is NP-hard also, but approximate methods work well for many real-world problems.    

**The parameter learning task in Bayesian networks**  
*   Given: a set of training instances, the graph structure of a BN.  
*   Do: infer the parameters of the CPDs.  

**The structure learning task in Bayesian networks**  
*   Given: a set of training instances.  
*   Do: infer the graph structure (and perhaps the parameters of the CPDs too)  

**Parameter learning and MLE**  
**Overview**  
*   Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)  
    *   Given a model structure (e.g. a Bayes net graph) $G$ and a set of data $D$.  
    *   Set the model parameters $\theta$ to maximize $P(D\lvert G, \theta)$.   
*   i.e. make the data $D$ look as likely as possible under the model $P(D\lvert G, \theta)$  

**Parameter learning and MAP**  
**Overview**  
*   Instead of estimating parameters strictly from the data,  
we could start with some **prior belief** for each.
*   **Laplace Estimates**  
    *   $n_v$ represents the number of occurrences of value $v$.
    $$
    P(X=x) = \frac{n_x+1}{\sum_{v\in Values(X)}(n_v+1)}
    $$
*   **M-estimates**  
    *   $p_x$ prior probability of value $x$  
    *   Number of "Virtual" instances  
    $$
    P(X=x) = \frac{n_x+p_xm}{\sum_{v\in Values(X)}(n_v) + m}
    $$

****  
**Missing Data**  
*   Hidden variables; Values missing at random 
    *   these are the cases we’ll focus on  
    *   one solution: try impute the values  
*   Values missing systematically  
    *   may be sensible to represent “missing” as an explicit feature value  

**Imputing missing data with EM**  
**Overview**  
Given:  
*   Data set with some missing values.  
*   Model structure, initial model parameters.  

Repeat until convergence:  
*   **Expectation** (E) step: using current model, compute expectation over missing values  
*   **Maximization** (M) step: update model parameters with those that maximize probability of the data (MLE or MAP)  
    * i.e. Re-estimate probabilities using expected counts.  
    
**Covergence of EM**  
*   E and M steps are iterated until probabilities converge  
*   Will converge to a maximum in the data likelihood (MLE or MAP)  
*   The maximum may be a local optimum.  
*   The optimum found depends on starting conditions (initial estimated probability parameters)  


**Learning structure + parameters**  
*   Number of structures is superexponential in the number of
variables  
*   Finding optimal structure is NP-complete problem  
*   Two common options:  
    *   Search very restricted space of possible structures (e.g. networks with tree DAGs)   
    *   Use heuristic search (e.g. sparse candidate)  

**The Chow-Liu algorithm**  
**Overview**  
*   Learns a BN with a tree structure that maximizes the likelihood of the training data  
*   Notice, Chow-Liu algorithm always has a complete graph.  
*   **Algorithm**:
    1.  Compute weight $I(X_i,X_j)$ of each possible edge $(X_i, X_j)$
        *   Use mutual information to calculate edge weights. $I(X,Y) = \sum_{x\in X}\sum_{y\in Y}P(x,y)\log_2\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}$
            $$
            \begin{aligned}
                I(X; Y) &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}, y\in\mathcal{Y}}P_{(X,Y)}(x,y)\log{\frac{P_{(X,Y)}(x,y)}{P_X(x)P_Y(y)}} \\
                &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}, y\in\mathcal{Y}}P_{(X,Y)}(x,y)\log{\frac{P_{(X,Y)}(x,y)}{P_X(x)}} - \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}, y\in\mathcal{Y}}P_{(X,Y)}(x,y)\log{P_Y(y)} \\
                &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}, y\in\mathcal{Y}}P_X(x)P_{Y\lvert X=x}(y)\log{P_{Y\lvert X=x}(y)} - \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}, y\in\mathcal{Y}}P_{(X,Y)}(x,y)\log{P_Y(y)} \\
                &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}P_X(x)(\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}P_{Y\lvert X=x}(y)\log{P_{Y\lvert X=x}(y)}) - \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}(\sum_{x}P_{X,Y}(x,y))\log{P_Y(y)} \\
                &= -\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}P(x)H(Y\lvert X=x) - \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}P_Y(y)\log{P_Y(y)}\\
                &= -H(Y\lvert X) + H(Y) \\
                &= H(Y) - H(Y\lvert X)
            \end{aligned}
            $$
    2.  Find maximum weight spanning tree (MST)
        *   A maximal-weight tree that connects all vertices in a graph.
        *   **Prim's algorithm** and **Kruskal's algorithm**. Go review CS400.
    3.  Assign edge directions in MST.
        *   Pick a node for the root, and assign edge directions.
    
**Heuristic search for structure learning**  
*   Each state in the search space represents a DAG Bayes net structure.  
*   To instantiate a search approach, we need to specify  
    *   Scoring function  
    *   State transition operators  
    *   Search algorithm  
    
**Scoring Function**  
**Decomposability**  
When the appropriate priors are used, and all instances in D are complete, the scoring function can be decomposed as follows  

$$
score(G,D) = \sum_iscore(X_i, Parents(X_i):D)
$$

This decomposability allows us to  
1.  Score a network by summing terms over the nodes in the netwrok.  
2.  Efficiently score changes in a local search procedure.  

**Structure learning**  
One general approach for BN structure search  

$$
\arg\max_{G,\theta_G}\log P(D\lvert G,\theta_G) - f(m)\lvert \theta_G\lvert 
$$

where the $f(m)\lvert \theta_G\lvert$ is the complexity penalty.  
***Akaike Informtion Criterion (AIC)***  

$$
f(m) = 1
$$

***Bayesian Informtion Criterion (AIC)***  

$$
f(m) = \frac{1}{2}\log (m)
$$

**Structure search operators**  

*   Add an edge
*   Delete an edge
*   Reverse an edge

**Bayesian Network Search**  
**Algorithm 1: Hill-Climbing**  
given: data set $D$, initial network $B_0$  

*<u>Pseudocode:</u>*    
$i=0$  
$B_{best} \leftarrow B_0$  
while stopping criteria not met  
{  
$\quad$for each possible operator application $\alpha$  
$\quad${  
$\quad\quad${  
$\quad\quad\quad B_{best} \leftarrow apply(\alpha,B_i)$  
$\quad\quad\quad$if $score(B_{new})>score(B_{best})$  
$\quad\quad\quad\quad B_{best} \leftarrow B_{new}$  
$\quad\quad$}  
$\quad$++$i$  
$\quad$$B_i \leftarrow B_{best}$  
}  
return $B_i$  

**Algorithm 2: the Sparse Candidate algorithm**  
given: data set $D$, initial network $B_0$, parameter $k$  

*<u>Pseudocode:</u>*  
$i=0$  
repeat  
{  
$\quad$++$i$  

$\quad$// restrict step  
$\quad$select for each variable $X_j$ a set $C_j^i$ of candidate parents $(\lvert C_j^i\lvert  \leq k)$  

$\quad$// maximize step  
$\quad$find network $B_i$ maximizing score among networks where $\forall X_j,  Parents(X_j) \subseteq C_j^i$  
} until convergence  
return $B_i$  

**The restrict step in Sparse Candidate Algorithm**  
To identify candidate parents in the first iteration, can compute the mutual information between pairs of variables, $I(X,Y) = \sum_{x\in X}\sum_{y\in Y}P(x,y)\log_2\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}$

**Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence** provides a distance measure between two distributions, $P$ and $Q$  

$$
D_{KL}(P(X)\lvert Q(X)) = \sum_xP(x)\log\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
$$

KL divergence can be used to assess the discrepancy between the network’s $P_{net}(X, Y)$ and the empirical $P(X, Y)$.  

$$
M(X,Y) = D_{KL}(P(X,Y)\lvert P_{net}(X,Y))
$$

Notice, $P_{net}(X,Y)$ can be estimated through sampling from the network.  


given: data set $D$, initial network $B_0$, parameter $k$  

*<u>Pseudocode of restrict step:</u>*  
for each variable $X_j$  
{  
$\quad$ calculate $M(X_j,X_l)$ for all $X_j \neq X_l$  such that $X_l \notin Parents(X_j)$  

$\quad$ choose highest ranking $X_l, \cdots X_{k-s}$ where $s=\lvert Parents(X_j)\lvert$  

$\quad$ // include current parents in candidate set to ensure monotonic  
$\quad$ // improvement in scoring function  
$\quad$ $C_j^i = Parents(X_j) \cup X_1 ... X_{k-s}$  
}  
return $\{ C_j^i \}$ for all $X_j$  

**The maximize step in Sparse Candidate**  
*   Hill-climbing search with add-edge, delete-edge,  reverse-edge operators.  
*   Test to ensure that cycles aren’t introduced into the graph.  

**Bayes nets for classification**  
Previously discussed method are mainly unsupervised. However, BN learning can be also used for a standard supervised task (learn a model to predict $Y$ given $X_1,... , X_n$).  
*   One very simple BN approach for supervised tasks is naïve Bayes  
*   In naïve Bayes, we assume that all features $X_i$ are conditionally independent given the class $Y$  

**Naive Bayes**  
Learning:  
*   Estimate $P(Y = y)$ for each value of the class variable $Y$  
*   Estimate $P(X_i=x \lvert  Y = y)$ for each $X_i$  

Classification: use Bayes' Rule  

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y = y\lvert x) &= \frac{P(y)P(x\lvert y)}{\sum_{y'}P(x\lvert y')} \\
&= \frac{P(y)\prod_{i=1}^nP(x_i\lvert y)}{\sum_{y'}(P(y')\prod_{i=1}^nP(x_i\lvert y'))}
\end{aligned}
$$

**The Tree Augmented Network (TAN) algorithm**  
*   Learns a tree structure to augment the edges of a naïve Bayes network.  
*   Algorithm:  
    1.   Compute weight $I(X_i,X_j\lvert Y)$ for each possible edge $(X_i,X_j)$ between features  
    2.   Find maximum weight spanning tree (MST) for graph over $X_l ... X_n$  
    3.   Assign edge direction in MST    
    4.   Construct a TAN model by adding node for $Y$ and an edge from $Y$ to each $X_i$  
*   Condition mutual information  
    $$
    I(X_i,X_j\lvert Y) = \sum_{x_i\in X_i}\sum_{x_j\in X_j}\sum_{y\in Y}P(x_i, x_j, y)\log_2\frac{P(x_i,x_j\lvert y)}{P(x_i\lvert y)P(x_j\lvert y)}
    $$

**Tan Network Example**  
![Tan Network](https://yujias424.github.io/img/Tan_Network.png)


**TAN vs. Chow-Liu**  
*   TAN is focused on learning a Bayes net specifically for
classification problems  
*   The MST includes only the feature variables (the class
variable is used only for calculating edge weights) 
*   Conditional mutual information is used instead of mutual information in determining edge weights in the undirected graph 
*   The directed graph determined from the MST is added to the $Y \rightarrow X_i$ edges that are in a naïve Bayes network.
