### Support Vector Machines

##### Motivation
Linear classification usually assume perfect separation between the two classes. However, if a new data point is introduced to the system, the current linear model may not be able to capture it. Therefore, the margin is introduced to address this problem.

##### Margin

**Lemma 1**  
$x$ has distance $\frac{|f_w(x)|}{||w||}$ to the hyperplane $f_w(x) = w^Tx = 0$.

Proof:  
$w$ is orthogonal to the hyperplane. (点法式)  
The unit direction is $\frac{w}{||w||}$
The projection of $x$ is $(\frac{w}{||w||})^Tx = \frac{f_w(x)}{||w||}$ 

Remarks:  
Proof of the distance of a given point $Q$($x_0$, $y_0$, $z_0$) to a given hyperplane $Ax+Bx+Cx+D=0$, or say $w^Tx+D=0$. To simplify the calculation, we use 3 dimension space.

Take a randomly pick point $P$($x$, $y$, $z$) located on the plane. Build a normal vector $\vec{n}$ = ($A$, $B$, $C$) = $w$ cross the point $P$. And we can easily think of that the distance of $Q$ and the plane is just the length of the projection of $Q$ on the $\vec{n}$. Therefore, we have  

$$
\begin{aligned}
d &= |\vec{PQ}| \cdot \cos{\theta}\\
&= \frac{|\vec{n}|}{|\vec{n}|} \cdot |\vec{PQ}| \cdot \cos{\theta} \\
&= \frac{|\vec{n}|\cdot |\vec{PQ}| \cdot \cos{\theta}}{|\vec{n}|} \\
&= \frac{A(x_0-x) + B(y_0-y) + C(z_0-z)}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}} \\
&= \frac{Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 - (Ax + By + Cz)}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}} \\
&= \frac{Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 + D}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}} \\
&= \frac{f_w(x)}{||w||}
\end{aligned}
$$

$|\vec{A}|\cdot |\vec{B}| \cdot \cos{\theta}$ is just the projection of vector A on the vector B    
$PQ = (x_0-x, y_0-y, z_0-z)$  
Since P located on the plane, thus $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$.

**Claim 1**  
$w$ is orthogonal to the hyperplane $f_{w,b}(x) = w^Tx+b = 0$.

**Claim 2**  
$0 (0,0,0)$ has distance $\frac{|b|}{||w||}$ to the hyperplane $f_{w,b}(x) = w^Tx+b = 0$.

**Lemma 2**  
$x$ has distance $\frac{f_{w,b}(x)}{||w||}$ to the hyperplane $f_{w,b}(x) = w^Tx+b = 0$.

Proof:  
Let $x = x_a + r\frac{w}{||w||}$, then |r| is the distance, $x_a$ locates on the plane.  

$$
\begin{aligned}
&x = x_a + r\frac{w}{||w||} \\
\rightarrow &w^Tx + b = w^T(x_a + r\frac{w}{||w||}) + b \\
\rightarrow &f_{w,b}(x) = f_{w,b}(x_a) + \frac{rw^Tw}{||w||} \\
\rightarrow &f_{w,b}(x) = 0 + r||w||
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we prove that $r = \frac{f_{w,b}(x)}{||w||}$.
$f_{w,b}(x_a) = 0$ is because $x_a$ locates on the plane. 

##### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Objective**

* Margin over all training data points:
$$
\gamma = \min_{i}\frac{|f_{w,b}(x_i)|}{||w||}
$$
* Only want correct $f_{w,b}$, and $y_i \in \{+1, -1\}$, we have,
$$
\gamma = \min_{i}\frac{y_if_{w,b}(x_i)}{||w||}
$$
* If $f_{w,b}$ incorrect on some, the margin is negative.
* Maximize margin over all training data points:
$$
\max_{w,b}\gamma = \max_{w,b}\min_i \frac{y_if_{w,b}(x_i)}{||w||} = \max_{w,b}\min_i \frac{y_i(w^Tx_i +b)}{||w||}
$$

**Simplified Objective**  
**Claim 1**  
When $(w,b)$ scaled by a factor $c$, the margin won't change, that is 
$$
\frac{y_i(w^Tx_i +b)}{||w||} = \frac{y_i(cw^Tx_i +cb)}{||cw||}
$$
Therefore, we can consider a fixed scale such that 
$$
y_{i*}(w^Tx_{i*} + b) = 1
$$
where $x_{i*}$ is the point closet to the hyperplane.
Therefore, for all other data, we have,
$$
y_{i*}(w^Tx_{i*} + b) \geq 1
$$
The margin thus is $\frac{1}{||w||}$, and the optimization can be simplified to
$$
\begin{aligned}
    &
    \begin{cases}
        &\max \min_{w,b}\frac{y_{i}(w^Tx_{i} + b)}{||w||}\\
        &y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1, \forall i
    \end{cases}\\

    \rightarrow&\begin{cases}
        &\max_{w,b} \frac{1}{||w||}\min_{x_i}y_{i}(w^Tx_{i} + b)\\
        &y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1, \forall i
    \end{cases}\\

    \rightarrow&\begin{cases}
        &\max_{w,b} \frac{1}{||w||}\min_{x_i*}y_{i*}(w^Tx_{i*} + b)\\
        &y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1, \forall i
    \end{cases}\\

    \rightarrow&\begin{cases}
        &\max_{w,b} \frac{1}{||w||} \cdot 1\\
        &\min y_{i*}(w^Tx_{i*}+b) = 1, \forall i
    \end{cases}\\

    \rightarrow&\begin{cases}
        &\min_{w,b}\frac{1}{2}||w||^2\\
        &y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1, \forall i
    \end{cases}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

To be notice, $\min y_{i}(w^Tx_{x_i}+b) = 1$ has the same meaning as the $y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1$
Therefore, we want to minimize the $\frac{1}{2}||w||^2$.  

Remarks:
Maximum margin classifier means that we want to find the margin that can maximize the smallest distance to the margin. Can think like this way, when you are walking on a road where both sides of the road are cliff, the safest location must be the center of the road.

##### Lagrange Multiplier
To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, we will introduce the application of lagrangian.

**Lagrangian**  
Consider optimization problem:  
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\min_wf(w) \\
h_i(w) &= 0, \forall 1\leq i \leq l
\end{aligned}
$$
We have lagrangian:  
$$
\mathcal{L}(w, \beta) = f(w) + \sum_{i}\beta_ih_i(w)
$$
where $\beta_i$ are called lagrange multipiler.
Can be solved by setting derivatives of Lagrangian to 0.  
$$
\frac{\partial{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial{w_i}} =0; \,\,\frac{\partial{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial{\beta_i}} =0
$$

**Generalized Lagrangian**  
Consider optimization problem:  
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\min_wf(w) \\
g_i(w) &\leq 0, \forall 1\leq i \leq k\\
h_j(w) &= 0, \forall 1\leq j \leq l
\end{aligned}
$$
Generalized Lagrangian:  
$$
\mathcal{L}(w, \beta) = f(w) + \sum_{i}\alpha_ig_i(w) + \sum_{j}\beta_jh_j(w)
$$
Consider the quantity:  
$$
\theta_p(w) := \max_{\alpha, \beta:\alpha_i \geq 0} \mathcal{L}(w, \alpha, \beta)
$$
According to the aformention s.t. condition, minimizing $f(w)$ is the same thing as minimizing $\theta_p(w)$  
$$
\min_wf(w) = \min_w\theta_p(w) = \min_w\max_{\alpha, \beta:\alpha_i \geq 0} \mathcal{L}(w, \alpha, \beta)
$$

**Lagrange duality**  
The primal problem  
$$
p^* := \min_wf(w) = \min_w\max_{\alpha, \beta:\alpha_i \geq 0} \mathcal{L}(w, \alpha, \beta)
$$
The dual problem  
$$
d^* := \max_{\alpha, \beta:\alpha_i \geq 0}\min_w \mathcal{L}(w, \alpha, \beta)
$$
<u>*Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions*</u>  
Under KKT conditions, there exists $(w, \alpha, \beta)$ such that  
$$
d^* = \mathcal{L}(w^*, \alpha^*, \beta^*) = p^*
$$
Following is the KKT condition:  
$$
\begin{cases}
&\frac{\partial{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial{w_i}} = 0 \\
&\alpha_ig_i(w) = 0 \,\,\,\,(Dual\,\, complementarity)\\
& g_i(w)\leq0, \,\,h_j(w)=0 \,\,\,\,(Primal\,\, constraints)\\
& \alpha_i \geq 0 \,\,\,\,(Dual\,\, constraints)
\end{cases}
$$

##### SVM Optimization
Recall the optimization problem,  
$$
\begin{cases}
&\min_{w,b}\frac{1}{2}||w||^2\\
&y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1, \forall i
\end{cases}
$$
We have the generalized Lagrangian  
$$
\mathcal{L}(w,b,\alpha) = \frac{1}{2}||w||^2 - \sum_{i}\alpha_i[y_i(w^Tx_i+b) -1]
$$
where $\alpha$ is the lagrange multiplier.  
Next, we want to check the KKT conditions:  
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial{w}} = 0 \rightarrow w = \sum_{i}\alpha_iy_ix_i\\
&\frac{\partial{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial{b}} = 0 \rightarrow 0= \sum_{i}\alpha_iy_i
\end{aligned}
$$
Notice, $\frac{\partial{w^TB}}{\partial w} = B$  
Plug into $\mathcal{L}$, we have  
$$
\mathcal{L}(w,b,\alpha) = \sum_i\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}\alpha_i\alpha_jy_iy_jx_i^Tx_j
$$
Therefore, the problem is reduced to a dual problem,  
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(w,b,\alpha) &= \sum_i\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}\alpha_i\alpha_jy_iy_jx_i^Tx_j \\
&\sum_i\alpha_iy_i = , \,\,\alpha_i \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
Since $w = \sum_i\alpha_iy_ix_i$, we have $w^Tx+n = (\sum_i\alpha_iy_ix_i^T)x+b$, only depend on inner products $x_i^Tx_j$  

**Support Vectors**
* Final solution is a sparse linear combination of the training instances.
* Those instances with $\alpha_i > 0$ are called support vectors, these instances lie on the margin boundary.
* Solution not changed if delete the instances with $\alpha_i=0$

**Learning Theory Justification**  
To minimize the VC dimension leads to maximize the margin.

##### Variants: Soft-margin and SVR
**Soft-margin SVM**  
Recalled Hard-margin SVM,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\min_{w,b}\frac{1}{2}||w||^2\\
y_i(&w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1, \forall i
\end{aligned}
$$

However, if the training instances are not linearly separable, hard-margin will fail. Therefore, to address this problem, slack variables (denoted by $\xi_i$) are introduced to tolerate errors.  
We have **soft-margin SVM**,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\min_{w,b}\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C\sum_i\zeta_i\\
y_i(w^T&x_i+b) \geq 1-\zeta_i,\,\,\zeta_i\geq 0\,\, \forall i
\end{aligned}
$$

$C$ determines the relative importance of maximizing margin vs. minimizing slack. $\zeta_i$ is the hinge loss.

**Hinge Loss**  
Different from minimizing squared loss and cross-entropy loss, SVMs minimize hinge loss.
Definition of hinge loss in SVM, y is the label, i.e. $\pm 1$

$$
\mathcal{l}(y) = \max (0, 1-f(x)\cdot y)
$$

**Support Vector Regression**  
<u>*Overview*</u>
* the SVM idea can also be applied in regression tasks
* an  $\epsilon$-insensitive error function specifies that a training instance is well explained if the model’s prediction is within $\epsilon$ of $y_i$
* Regression using slack variables (denoted by $\zeta_i$, $\xi_i$) to tolerate errors.
We have **Support Vector Regression**  
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\min_{w,b,\zeta_i, \xi_i} \frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C\sum_i(\zeta_i+\xi_i) \\
&(w^Tx_i+b)-y_i\leq \epsilon + \zeta_i\\
&y_i-(w^Tx_i+b)\leq \epsilon + \xi_i\\
&\zeta_i,\xi_i\geq0
\end{aligned}
$$  
Slack variables allow predictions for some training instances to be off by more than $\epsilon$.

##### Kernel Method
**Idea**  
A proper feature mapping can make non-linear to linear.  

Recalled the SVM dual form, the $x_i^Tx_j$ can be replaced by $\phi(x_i)^T\phi(x_j)$, where $\{\phi(x_i)\}$ denotes a feature space that SVM will be applied. To be noticed, we don't need to design $\phi(\cdot)$, only need to design the kernel, $k(x_i,x_j) = \phi(x_i)^T\phi(x_j)$  

**Polynomial kernels**  
Fix degree $d$ and constant $c$:  
$$
k(x,x') = (x^Tx' + c)^d
$$
An example of polynomial kernels,  
$$
\forall x, x' \in \mathbb{R}^2, K(x,x') = (x_1x_1' + x_2x_2'+c)^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    &x^2_1 \\ &x^2_2 \\ &\sqrt{2}x_1x_2 \\&\sqrt{2c}x_1 \\&\sqrt{2c}x_2 \\& c
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
    &x'^2_1 \\ &x'^2_2 \\ &\sqrt{2}x'_1x'_2 \\&\sqrt{2c}x'_1 \\&\sqrt{2c}x'_2 \\& c
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Gaussian/Radial Basis Function(RBF) kernels**
* Fix bandwidth $\sigma$:  
$$
k(x,x') = exp(\frac{-||x-x'||^2}{2\sigma^2})
$$
* Un-normalized version  
$$
k'(x,x') = exp(\frac{x^Tx'}{\sigma^2})
$$
* Power series expansion  
$$
k'(x,x') = \sum_{i}^{+\infty}\frac{(x^Tx')^i}{\sigma^ii!}
$$
* Mercer's condition for kernels  
$k(x, x')$ has expansion.  
$$
k(x, x') = \sum_i^{+\infty}\alpha_i\phi(x)\phi(x')
$$
if and only if for any function $c(x)$,  
$$
\int\int c(x)c(x')k(x,x')dxdx'\geq0
$$
****
**Kernels Algebra**  
Kernels are closed under positive scaling, sum, product, pointwise limit, and composition with a power series $\sum_i^{+\infty}\alpha_ik^i(x,x')$.
